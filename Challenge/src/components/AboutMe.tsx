                Hi, I'm Maurice Zuniga. I'm a full stack developer with a passion for creating web applications. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Express. I'm always looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills. I'm excited to work on new projects and collaborate with other developers. Before transitioning to tech, I managed a movie theater, where I honed my leadership and customer service skills.  Now, I have a passion for creating user-friendly interfaces and solving complex technical challenges. I'm excited to bring my unique perspective to a team of talented developers.
